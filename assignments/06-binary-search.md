1. Implement Assignment One and two from [Linear Search](https://github.com/golclinics/golclinics-dsa/blob/main/assignments/06-linear-search.md) using Binary Search. Use Recursive approach for the implementation.
2. Calculate Time and Space complexity differences between Linear and Binary search algorithms i.e. Linear Search, Binary Iterative search and Binary Recursive search.
3. BONUS:: Try out: [Binary Search in a tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)
